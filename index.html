<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, hosted by Professor <a href="https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Alberto Leon-Garcia</a>. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, in Jan. 2018, and my B.Eng. degree with First Class Honor from the Department of Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2012. From Oct. 2015 to May 2016, I was a visiting research fellow in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Sequential Decision Making</b>. Sequential decision making is concerned about designing algorithms that take the dynamics of the world into consideration, and thus enable intelligent agents to take appropriate actions where earlier decisions influences the later ones. Key theoretic frameworks to studying sequential decision making under uncertainty include Markov decision process, reinforcement learning and approximate dynamic programming.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Algorithmic Mechanism Design</b>. Algorithmic mechanism design is concerned about designing distributed protocols that will lead to a desired objective despite the existence of self-interested participants or agents. In particular, online mechanism design of multi-agent systems in the presence of uncertainty lies at the intersection of economic game theory and theoretic computer science where analytical tools such as worst-case analysis of online algorithms and approximation algorithms are frequently used. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Performance Evaluation</b>. Performance evaluation plays an important role in modeling and analyzing the quality-of- service of real-world service systems subject to uncertainty. The goal is to derive analytical solutions and insight into the design and operation of real-world service systems based on stochastic models including queueing theory and Markov chain, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am ehusiastic in applying the above techniques to applications that have profound environmental, economic and societal impact, including smart power grids, electric vehicle networks, and urban mobility systems. </p>
