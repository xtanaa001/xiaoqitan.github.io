<h2>Power and Energy Systems</h2>
<p>One of the central issues confronting grid operators is that the current design of power distribution system is unaccustomed to intermittency, a major characteristic of distributed energy resources (DERs). In the absence of effective tools and methodologies to manage high levels of DERs, the power grid will experience frequency and voltage variations, overloads of transformers and transmission lines, phase load imbalances, and other variations from  operating standards of power grids. Given these challenges, new tools and methodologies must be developed for the technical and economic management of power grids with high penetration of DERs.  </p>
<p>One of the most promising solutions to cope with the intermittency of DERs is the integration of distributed battery energy storage (BES). In recent years, we have been working on many problems regarding planning and operation of BES. We propose new models and algorithms for analyzing the economic and lifetime performance of distributed BES systems in smart power grids. We also study how to integrate renewable energy in future smart power grids with EV battery charging stations. Meanwhile, we have also developed novel distributed algorithms for the energy management of cooperative microgrids with integration of BES. </p>

<h2>Smart and Sustainable Cities</h2>
<p>The concept of smart cities is an urban development vision aiming to improve the cities&rsquo; sustainability and the citizens&rsquo; quality of life by means of information and communication technology. By 2050, 70% of the world's population is projected to live and work in cities, with transportation and energy as major constituents. Battery electric vehicles have significantly higher energy efficiency when compared to gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles, which are widely believed to become mainstream in the coming decades. Therefore, it is projected that there will be a large number of mobile batteries, facilitated by electric vehicles either with or without drivers, moving around in future smart cities. As a result, two orginally separated large systems, i.e., the power system and the transportation system, will become increasingly correlated both in their design and operation, which yields many new challenges and requires a substantial research.</p>
<p>We are interested in all kinds of applications in smart cities, but primarily focus on transportation and energy. We have been working on smart homes, smart buildings, and smart power grids, in which charging and discharging scheduling of electric vehicles plays a very important role. In particular, we investigate the planning and operation of energy refueling infrastructures of electric vehicles (including battery-swapping mode and plug-in charging mode) in smart cities. Meanwhile,  autonomous electric vehicles will also be a very important part of future energy-transportation nexus, which is a prominent example of smart city application. </p>

<h2>Energy-Efficient Networking and Computing</h2>
<p>Fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure in which data, computation, storage and applications are distributed in the most logical, efficient place between the data source and the cloud. Fog computing essentially extends cloud computing and services to the edge of the network, bringing the advantages and power of the cloud closer to where data is created and acted upon. The goal of fog computing is to improve efficiency and reduce the amount of data transported to the cloud for processing, analysis and storage. </p>
<p>With the increasing development of Internet of Things, e.g., tremendous networked and heterogeneous devices in smart cities or connected vehicles, we have an excellent opportunity to bring the ‘cloud’ closer to the edge and users as ‘fog’. Previously, we have worked on the optimal resource allocation for LET-A downlink with heterogeneous traffic types. Recently, we start to investigate many interesting engineering and economic problems in vehicular fog computing with slow-driving and/or parked vehicles. </p>
