<p><b>Summary</b>: My research interests lie in the performance analysis and optimization of energy, computing and networking systems. The ultimate goal of my research is to achieve efficiency, sustainability, and intelligence in the planning and operation of real-world networks and systems. My research is application-driven and inherently interdisciplinary, with tools drawn from optimization theory, queueing theory, proability, and machine learning. Some examples of past and current applications include distributed battery energy storage systems and electric vehicles in energy systems. </p>

<p><b>Current Projects</b>: My current research is particularly motivated by two important emerging components of smart grids, i.e., battery energy storage and electric vehicles. As a promising game-changer for future power and energy systems, battery energy storage is expected to play a key role in providing more flexibility for balancing the grid, buffering intermittent renewable energy, and improving the stability of local distribution networks. Driven by the growing demand for cutting down greenhouse gas emissions in transportation sector, the past decade has witnessed an explosive growth in development and deployment of electric vehicles.  When batteries are moving around enabled by electric vehicles, two orginally separated large networks, i.e., the power network and the transportation network, are becoming increasingly correlated in their design and control, which yields many new challenges and requires a substantial research.</p>
