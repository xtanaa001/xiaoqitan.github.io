== Biography
I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, in 2018, and my B.Eng. degree with First Class Honor from the Department of Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2012. From Oct. 2015 to May 2016, I was a fellow in Electrical Engineering of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Harvard University. 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, hosted by Professor [https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/ Alberto Leon-Garcia]. I am broadly interested in optimization, distributed and online algorithms, stochastic modeling and performance analysis. My current research lies at the intersection of [/research.html Energy, Communication and Transportation Networks].
