== Biography
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the ECE Department at HKUST. Before joining HKUST, I received my B.E. degree from the Department of Information and Communication Engineering (first class honor), [http://www.xjtu.edu.cn Xi’an Jiaotong University], Xi’an (the home of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army Terracotta Warriors and Horses]), China, 2012. I am now with the research group of [http://c2e.ece.ust.hk/main/ Computing, Communications and Energy System Optimization] (C2E) in ECE department at HKUST leading by Prof. [http://www.ece.ust.hk/~eetsang/ Danny H.K. Tsang]. From Oct. 2015 to April 2016, I was a visiting research fellow in [http://seas.harvard.edu School of Engineering and Applied Science] (SEAS), [http://www.harvard.edu Harvard University].
