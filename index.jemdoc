== Biography
I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, hosted by Professor [https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/ Alberto Leon-Garcia]. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, in Jan. 2018, and my B.Eng. degree with First Class Honor from the Department of Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2012. From Oct. 2015 to May 2016, I was a visiting research fellow in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.


== Research

I am currently working on smart energy and distributed computing systems, with a focus on improving energy sustainability and algorithmic efficiency. Examples of past and current research projects include demand-side management in smart grids, electric vehicle networks in smart cities, and resource management in cloud/edge computing.  For more information, please see [/research.html Current Research] and [/publication_type.html Publication]. 

I am also broadly interested in the optimization of networked systems, focusing on designing incentives and decision-making algorithms for network operators such that a desired performance can be achieved through a collective behavior of its users\/customers\/agents. In particular, my research tends to focus on applications where online and sequential decision making under uncertain customer behaviors plays an important role, drawing on tools from online algorithms, economics, mechanism design, Markov decision process and stochastic models (e.g., queueing theory, Markov chain). 


# My research interests lie in optimization, performance evaluation, and mechanism design of large-scale systems, with a particular focus on energy systems and communication systems. 

#- *Mechanism Design*. Algorithmic mechanism design is concerned about designing distributed protocols that will lead to a desired objective despite the existence of self-interested agents. In particular, online mechanism design of multi-agent systems in the presence of uncertainty lies at the intersection of economic game theory and theoretic computer science where analytical tools such as worst-case analysis of online algorithms and approximation algorithms are frequently used. 

#- *Performance Evaluation*. Performance evaluation plays an important role in modeling and analyzing the quality-of- service of real-world service systems subject to uncertainty. The goal is to derive analytical solutions and insight into the design and operation of real-world service systems based on stochastic models including queueing theory and Markov chain, etc.

#- *Sequential Decision Making*. Sequential decision making is concerned about designing algorithms that take the dynamics of the world into consideration, and thus enable intelligent agents to take appropriate actions where earlier decisions influences the later ones. Key theoretic frameworks to studying sequential decision making under uncertainty include Markov decision process, reinforcement learning and approximate dynamic programming.  


#The goal is to design computationally-efficient algorithms that can guarantee optimality or sub-optimality with performance bounds. 

#I am ehusiastic in developing new methodologies for the technical and economic management of smart power grids with high penetration of distributed energy resources such as wind, solar and energy storage.  In the absence of effective tools and methodologies, the power grid will experience frequency and voltage variations, and overloads of transformers and transmission lines, etc. One of the central issues confronting grid operators is that the current design of power distribution system is unaccustomed to intermittency or uncertainty, a major characteristic of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as wind and solar. Motivated by these challenges, 
#- Electrified Transportation Systems. 
#Increasing popularity of electric vehicles necessitates development of infrastructure networks to provide energy refueling services for electric vehicles based on plug-in charging and/or battery swapping. 
#- Smart Mobility. 
#One of the central issues confronting grid operators is that the current design of power distribution system is unaccustomed to intermittency or uncertainty, a major characteristic of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as wind and solar. In the absence of effective tools and methodologies to manage high levels of DERs, the power grid will experience frequency and voltage variations, and overloads of transformers and transmission lines, etc. Motivated by these challenges, I am ehusiastic in developing new methodologies for the technical and economic management of smart power grids with high penetration of DERs.  

#In particular, I pay close attention to future energy and urban mobility systems, supported by key technologies and business models such as distributed energy resources in smart power grids, autonomous and electric vehicles, shared economy, intelligent transportation, information and communication techniques, etc.
